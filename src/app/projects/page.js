                            The soil parameters like fertility, moisture etc.. can be monitored by collecting data from the soil using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs). The major disadvantage of conventional UAVsused in smart farming is that their rotational and translational dynamics are coupled and hence they cannot directly interact with the crops. This limitation can be solved by introducing fully/over-actuated multi-rotor UAVs. This can be achieved by using fixed rotors at different orientations or actively tilting the rotors by separate actuation. Thus, the UAVs can collect data from the soil, collect uninterrupted continuous images of the field, and do airborne manipulations. However, existing fully actuated UAVs are not optimised for usage in agricultural fields. They have very less flight time and low payload capacity. This project aims the development of a fully actuated multi-rotor UAV for soil map generation through on-the-go soil data collection. The main objective of this project is to generate a soil map by soil data collection using a separate sensor-based measurement system using a fully actuated multi-rotor UAV.

The mobile base, equipped with two active wheels at the center and four passive castor wheels at the corners, ensures stability and precise maneuverability. Electronic circuits govern the entire system, employing Cytrone dual-channel motor drivers, an Arduino AtMega, limit switches, and a user-friendly controller with DPST switches and an Arduino joystick dual-axis module. This breakthrough system not only enhances patient comfort during transfers but also prioritizes efficiency, safety, and adaptability, promising to redefine standards in patient care.

                            <div className={styles.text1}>This project embarks on an innovative exploration in robotics, drawing inspiration from the biomechanics of large mammals, particularly elephants. The initiative stems from a meticulous study of elephant locomotion patterns, leading to the adoption of an ample gait for stability—a characteristic feature seen in heavy-weight animals. The chosen gait pattern, distributed weight-bearing, and three-link leg structure contribute significantly to the robot’s stability, diverging from the conventional two-legged models optimized for speed. Moreover, the exploration extends beyond limb mechanics, envisioning a trunk system inspired by snake-like robots, enhancing the robot's manipulation capabilities. This project delve into multidisciplinary aspects of robotics, from theoretical modeling to practical fabrication and control
