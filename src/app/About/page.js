          <p>In 2011, a group of students became enthused about participating in the prestigious international robotics event, RoboCon 2012. Despite their dedicated efforts during the holidays to construct robots, they encountered a financial obstacle. Seeking assistance from the institute, they were informed that they had yet to establish their credibility. Undeterred, two students decided to broaden their scope and explore additional opportunities in robotics.
            <br />
            <br />
            Consequently, a cohesive group of 14 students formed, seeking guidance from Mr. Sudheer A.P., a distinguished figure in the field of robotics in the college. Overcoming challenges, they proudly unveiled their first creation – the Plotterbot v1.0. This helped them to establish their credibility in the institution. Their journey continued with the restoration of a lab machine, extended lab access, and successful modeling endeavors. During their academic breaks, they dedicated their time on campus to working on projects. As a result of their efforts, a significant presentation on May 20th became a turning point. This led to the official recognition of the Robotics Interest Group (RIG) and consequently, securing the necessary funding for the upcoming RoboCon 2013.
            <br />
            <br />
            In a dedicated effort to share their knowledge, the Robotics Interest Group (RIG) organized a comprehensive workshop at NIT Calicut, focusing on the fundamental principles of robotics. The event aimed to impart essential insights and skills in the realm of robotics to the students of NIT Calicut. The workshop garnered substantial attention, attracting an impressive turnout of over a number of enthusiastic participants. The positive response and acclaim received for the event reflected the effectiveness of RIG's instructional approach. Their narrative underscores the transformative impact of passion, dedication, and a shared vision. It serves as an inspiration for all to persevere, explore every opportunity diligently, and invest unwavering effort, knowing that enduring commitment ultimately leads to success.</p>
